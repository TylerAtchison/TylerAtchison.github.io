    <h2>Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg spotted raising an army to besiege the peaceful town of Detroit</h2>
    <p>"I couldn't believe my eyes," said Detroit resident Christian Roux, 
        who claims to have seen the emperor addressing his troops at Belle Isle Park from the pinnacle of the Detroit Yacht Club. 
        "It was like something out of a Russian fairytale. 
        The soldiers were speaking antiquated dialects of German and Hungarian, and they looked ready to raise their colors 
        over the Renaissance Center."</p>

        Local man spotted alerting Grosse Pointe townsfolk of Bronze Age Sea Peoples Invasion
    </h3>
    <p>In a scene that could have been lifted straight out of ancient history, local man Christian Roux has been seen frantically warning the residents of Grosse Pointe about an impending invasion by the enigmatic Sea Peoples. 
        Christian Roux was first spotted atop the Grosse Pointe Yacht Club Tower, shouting and gesticulating towards the waters of Lake St. Clair at the Bronze Age invaders. For his quick acts of bravery, he was rewarded 
        by Smiling Entertainment CEO, Joe Smiling, with an all-inclusive vacation to T Tower Resort and Casino.</p>
